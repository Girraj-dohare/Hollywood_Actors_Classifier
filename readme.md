Introduction
Actor Face Recognition is an application of computer vision and machine learning that aims to identify and recognize the faces of famous individuals from images or videos. This project provides code and resources to implement a actor face recognition system using Python and  machine learning.

The project covers various steps involved in actor face recognition, such as data collection, face detection, feature extraction, training a model, and performing face recognition on new images or videos.

Features
Actor face detection and recognition.
Training models using custom or pre-existing datasets.
Evaluating model performance.
Recognizing celebrity faces in images or videos.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
